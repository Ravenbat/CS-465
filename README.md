## Full stack web application made using NodeJS and Express Framework
For this application I have used Express HTML, JavaScript and SPA. Express is a Node.js based web application framework that provides flexible set of features to develop front-end web application. Javascript is used to build web application features and display requests. I have used NoSQL mongoDB as a means to manage and create data flexibly without being restricted to traditional structures found in common relational databases.

JSON is different from Javascript in that it is used to serialize objects, arrays, numbers, strings and more. It is independent from any programming language so other languages other than Javascript can be used to utilize JSON objects. Benefits of reusable user interface would be:
- Reusable code can be factored and used again in later stages
- Can be reformatted with even less code
- Easy to utilize

One example would be that I used handlebars containing HTML codes most of the pages this application uses and instead of having HTML code in every page file, I used handlebar shortcut to render the pages, saving and reducing code.
App uses HTTP requests of GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE to modify data.
Thanks to this course, I have learned means and process of developing single page application using MEAN stack and mongoDB database. Different type of front and back end development tools and non-sql database. I will use this knowledge to gain more familiarity with development processes of applications and software development.
